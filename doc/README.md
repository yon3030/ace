# Introduction

The beginnings of an API documentation set for Ace. 

# Building

In this directory, just run 

    node build.js [path_to_ndoc]

`[path_to_ndoc]` is a required argument, indicating the location of your ndoc install, relative to the `build.js` file. By default, this will point to `./build/ndoc/bin/ndoc`.
