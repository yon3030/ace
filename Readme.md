Ace (Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor)
============================

Ace is a standalone code editor written in JavaScript. Our goal is to create a web based code editor that matches and extends the features, usability and performance of existing native editors such as TextMate, Vim or Eclipse. It can be easily embedded in any web page and JavaScript application. Ace is developed as the primary editor for [Cloud9 IDE](http://www.cloud9ide.com/) and the successor of the Mozilla Skywriter (Bespin) Project.

Features

History
-------

Previously known as “Bespin” or lately “Skywriter” it’s now known as Ace (Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor)! Bespin and Ace started as two independent projects both aiming to build a no compromise code editor component for the web. Bespin started as part of Mozilla Labs and was based on the canvas tag, while Ace is the Editor component of the Cloud9 IDE and is using the DOM for rendering. After the release of Ace at JSConf.eu 2010 in Berlin the Skywriter team decided to merge Ace with a simplified version of Skywriter's plugin system and some of Skywriter's extensibility points. All these changes have been merged back to Ace now, which supersedes Skywriter. Both Ajax.org and Mozilla are actively developing and maintaining Ace.
